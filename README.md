This repository includes code demonstrating how non-vaccine-preventable HPV is strongly associated with sexual behaviours, and how it might be used in regression models to account for changes over time in sexual behaviour when estimating vaccine impact and vaccine effectiveness in population settings. Natsal-2 and Natsal-3 datasets used in this analysis are available via the UK Data Archive (serial numbers SN 5223/SN 7799)
